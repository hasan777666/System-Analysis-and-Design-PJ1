- Release decisions are delayed due to incomplete data  

5. Project Objectives  

The goal of the system is to:

- Centralize automated testing data  
- Provide real-time dashboards  
- Automatically track bugs  
- Improve communication between QA and management  


6. Scope of the System  

The system will include:

- Integration with CI/CD pipelines  
- Test case management  
- Bug tracking module  
- Real-time analytics dashboard  
- Notification system
